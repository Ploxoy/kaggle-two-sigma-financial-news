# My kernel codes in "Two Sigma: Using News to Predict Stock Movements" competition

These codes are for the kaggle competition 
[Two Sigma: Using News to Predict Stock Movements
Use news analytics to predict stock price performance](https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-financial-news).

**This competition is the kernel only competition, there are many duplicated codes**
**because a kaggle kernel should be only a file.**

In addition, the competition is a two stage competition.  

The stages are

1. the first stage ended at January.  The final kernels were submitted.
2. the final scores will be recomputed at June based on these kernels and the new data.

Therefore, I don't know the private LB score for each kernel.  

My submitted kernels are under [./final_kernels](./final_kernels)  .
My final state of the code are [./not_final_kernels/final_local_but_oom_kernel.py](not_final_kernels/final_local_but_oom_kernel.py)   
(not submitted due to out of memory while running on kaggle).

## TODO

- [ ] show public lb scores for each kernel.
- [ ] add licences for used libraries
